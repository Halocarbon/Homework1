1.Fundamental reasons behind cloud's success:
The cloud has seen widespread adoption because of its ability to deliver scalability, flexibility, and cost savings. Here are the primary reasons for its success:

On-demand resource access: The cloud allows users to access computing resources (like storage, networking, and processing power) whenever they need them, without having to manage physical infrastructure.

Cost-efficiency: Cloud providers typically offer a pay-as-you-go model, reducing the need for large upfront capital investment in hardware.

Scalability and flexibility: The cloud enables users to easily scale their infrastructure to accommodate business growth or reduced demand.

Pros of Cloud:

Cost-effective: No need for large capital expenditures on infrastructure.

Scalability: Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand.

Remote accessibility: Data and applications can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.

Cons of Cloud:

Security concerns: Storing sensitive data in the cloud could expose it to security risks.

Downtime: Cloud service outages can disrupt access to applications and data.

Limited control: Users may have limited control over cloud infrastructure compared to on-premise systems.

2.Primary function of a hypervisor in virtualization:
The primary function of a hypervisor is to enable the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) on a physical machine by allocating hardware resources and ensuring that multiple virtual machines can run simultaneously without interfering with each other.

3.What is a virtual machine (VM)?
A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications just like a physical machine. VMs are hosted on a hypervisor and share the underlying hardware resources of the physical system.

4.Benefits of using virtual machines:

Isolation: VMs are isolated from each other and the host system, so if one VM crashes, it doesnâ€™t affect others.

Resource optimization: VMs allow multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine, improving hardware utilization.

Portability: VMs can be easily moved or cloned to different systems without compatibility issues.

Testing and development: Developers can create isolated environments for testing software without affecting the host system.

5.Five use cases of virtual machines:

Running multiple operating systems: A VM can run Windows on a Linux host or vice versa.

Server consolidation: Virtualizing multiple servers onto a single physical machine to save costs and resources.

Testing environments: Developers can test applications in isolated VMs without affecting production systems.

Disaster recovery: VMs can be backed up and restored more easily, facilitating recovery from hardware failures.

Cloud computing: VMs are fundamental to cloud infrastructures where resources are virtualized and dynamically allocated.

6.In virtualization, what is the guest operating system?

b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine.

7.What does virtual machine isolation mean?

c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system.

8.What is the benefit of virtual machine portability?

c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors.

9.What is the purpose of cloning a virtual machine?
Cloning a virtual machine allows you to create an exact copy of an existing VM. This is useful for quickly setting up a new instance of a system for testing, development, or deployment without having to configure everything from scratch.
